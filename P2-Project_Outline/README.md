## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a food recipe application that will allow users to save their favorite recipes or the recipes they want to try out. Users will be able to create an account, login, create, edit and save recipes. 

I chose to create this project because of my interest in cooking and trying out new recipes. I wanted to have a central place where I could conveniently and easily store recipes. This will work better than traditional browser bookmarks, papers or books in the sense that the app will be more organized and user friendly. This app will benefit people people who want a more organized and fun way of storing recipes.

### What I'll Have to Learn
To bring the website to life, I would like to learn how I can incoporate Javascript for my front-end. 

Also, It would be nice if users could be notified by text to alert them to a recipe they should try. I don't know yet how to go about this but I would like to learn Twilio's API for sms.
